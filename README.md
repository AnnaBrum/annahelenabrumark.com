## Portfolio website (forever) under construction!

This is my portfolio site where I take on the challenge of gathering my different projects, from web development to design and art.  
My goal is to keep the stack as minimal as possible and avoid introducing frameworks or libraries unnecessarily. How much can be solved with just HTML, CSS, and at most some vanilla JavaScript?  

The site is built with the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to make use of layouts and CSS bundling.  
The code is open source, so if you’d like to contribute suggestions or improvements — feel free!
