          <p>
            I am a frontend developer with roots in design and textile art,
            where my practice focused on the dialogue between the analogue and
            the digital. Working hands-on with materials and exploring systems,
            patterns and iterations ultimately led me to code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I combine my backgrounds in art, design and development to
            create responsive and maintainable interfaces, working with
            JavaScript, TypeScript and React. I also work across the full stack
            with Node.js, databases and backend integrations. I am especially
            interested in opportunities where I can bring together these two
            worlds of creative practice and technical development.
